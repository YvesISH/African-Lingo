### African - Lingo 
Our mission's focus for this trimester is education and our project is to help anyone learn and understand diverse African lingos and cultures. This project intends to help those who feel misplaced in a different culture and attempt to integrate into the culture accordingly. The project is essential for us as a team because we understand that we all come from different cultures, and what better way to bond as a team than by learning about our languages?
